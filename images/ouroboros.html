The above diagram was published in 1759 in &quot;L&quot;Azoth des philosophes&quot; by Basil Valentine.  It is a complex symbol illustrating the Seven Stages of Alchemical Transformation.  This transformation could be physical, psychological, or spiritual in nature.  There is a correspondence with the 7 Yogic Chakras.

1)  Calcination - Humility and letting go of attachments
2)  Dissolution - Going with the flow and being in touch with the masculine and feminine
3) Separation - Letting go of things not part of our true nature
4) Conjunction - Empowerment of our true selves, being creative
5) Fermentation - Being inspired by something greater than ourselves, the beginning of spirituality
6) Distillation - Raising of the psyche to the highest levels; opening of The Third Eye
7) Coagulation - Permanent consciousness in the highest aspirations of the mind; the Philosopher's Stone

The name Alchemy is derived from the Arabic word al-kimiya, which likely comes from Khem, the original name of Ancient Egypt, meaning The Black Land, after the color of the fertile soil around the Nile.  Alchemy was the secret art of Ancient Egypt, and along with Astrology, is one of the two oldest sciences and considered a gift from God.  Islamic Alchemists picked up knowledge of the art from Hellenistic Egyptian and Greek sources, when they conquered those areas.  They further advanced both the Philosophical and Practical sides of Alchemy through the middle ages.  This knowledge was then re-discovered by the West, during the crusades and  renaissance.

The above image is the cover of the Kitab Al-Aqalim (Book of Countries) by Abu 'l-Qasim al-'Iraqi was inspired by original Egyptian Hieroglyphics.

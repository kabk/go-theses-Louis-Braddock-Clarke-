  	<br>
  	<br>
Through the technical production of space, both material and
non-material mechanisms adjust the ways of listening and understanding
a positioning of self.
<br><br>
The focus of this paper draws the reader to the non-material
and the influences, sensitivities and aesthetic re-adjustments
towards the electromagnetic field. Often a place
of contemplation, the known sky has never been a transparent
landscape but a progressively stacking carrier of information
and noise. Therefore, alluding to an ‘electronic sky’
that takes the name of ‘The Ether’; a hybrid place holding
inter-dimensional qualities is evidenced. This is a site of
growing heritage, broadcasting the comprehensive data sets of
the ancient world and the present world while presenting the
co-ordinates of the next world.
<br><br>
A narration of this phenomena is unfolded and re-drawn
through outlining both the artistic and scientific measurements
of invisible and meta qualities. Through the act of
extending the human senses and being open to a geo-psychic
realm, a question arises of a new visual cartography of the
world we navigate. Through transduction we can detach from
being spectators, routine consumers or technicians and shift
towards active excavators of this immortal noise in the sky.

Electromagnetic waves run through every aspect of our daily
lives as everlasting emissions. This quotidian phenomenon
however is far from routine – the waves never repeat but
continuously shift in space and time. They can confront us
directly or subtly elude us. In physics terminology, an electromagnetic
field can be described as a property of space
caused by electrical charge. The components making up this
physical field are an electrical field (E-Field) and a magnetic
field (H-Field). This duality gives a certain complexity
that has proven fascinating for researchers from the early
days of their discovery to the present.
<br><br>
Connecting to our senses, this electromagnetic field is made
up of waves transporting electromagnetic energy. From a primal
frame of reference the energies are intangible – only a
small measure of the spectrum is visible light, the rest is
not seen or heard. As humans, we have an almost atavistic desire
to find out what these are, what they signify and how to
transduce them. Throughout this text the portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum under examination will be from the frequencies
of visible light all the way down to radio (770Terahertz
to 1Hertz).
<br><br>
There is a concentration on Earth of what media historian
Douglas Kahn calls an “object orient ontology” (Kahn, 2010).
This outlook needs to be broken down from a plenitude of objects
into a plenitude of energies. Awakening to the matter
that electro-energies run through everything, from the nerves
in the body all the way to cables transporting whispers to
distant skies. Such a magnitude of the electromagnetic array
evades a definition of place and is embedded in the everyday
habitats of human activities. This non-place offers a new
outlook upon the existing object capital perspective.
<br><br>
Towards the later 18th century Thomas Watson (assistant to
Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone in 1876) became one of
the first humans to listen to natural-radio/electromagnetic
signals. This involved telegraph lines running between modems
that acted as antennas to harvest electromagnetic waves.
Thus, “Radio was heard before it was invented” (Kahn, 2013).
The sounds heard by Watson related to natural signals such
as solar flares, auras and lightning storms. At this point in
time, these natural occurrences would have bemused, or even
terrified. However, today’s signals could not be termed ‘natural’
where global warming is altering electromagnetic waves
produced by lightning storms.

  <div class="content3">
More and more urban spaces are being occupied by ‘un-natural’
electromagnetic waves unrelentingly being emitted by
machines. These machines (such as transportation, communication,
entertainment or completely new infrastructures) run
at different scales that are centralised around the modes
of electricity. One example is the National Grid where, in
most countries a wave between 50-60Hertz (Hz) is audible as
a very low frequency (VLF) – a constant ‘hum’. A walk through
most cities with a VLF receiver amasses an array of synthetic
sounds emitted from omni-directional electro-sources. These
are superimposed and orchestrated on top of the baseline hum.
Such signals have to undergo a process of transduction to be
apparent. This is a mode of mechanically transforming a signal
into a materiality, in these examples sound is that material.
This is proving fascinating to a whole new area of
investigation that strongly links the senses and our omnipresent
need to position the ‘self’ in the universe that we
live in.
<br><br>
In 1918, Serbian electrical inventor and futurist Nikola Tesla
constructed experiments resulting in an audible pick up
from the electromagnetic spectrum, he stated;
<br><br>
“The sounds I am listening to every night at first appear
to be human voices conversing back and forth in a language I
cannot understand. I find it difficult to imagine that I am
actually hearing real voices from people not of this planet.”
(Tesla, 1918).
<br><br>
This thesis further discusses the aspects of fields within
space, with a particular concentration on crossovers of the
virtual ether that inflicts or directs physical movement. As
a starting point, we can break sound/noise into two areas.
<br><br>
– Acoustic; dealing with the mechanics of hearing in an
exact space.
<br><br>
– Psychological; examining noise as a perception.
<br><br>
Data and information become physical dictators in space,
crafting new micro-cities to then be re-navigated by the
human body. Signals are perceived as a distorted invisible
sector that remains a mystification of influencing self-movement.
That is, until knowledge of the wireless sub-world is
acquired. This new place of being can possibly emerge by
taking a step back from the existing world frame to allow
for pluralism in new rhythms, receptions and dimensions.

Throughout the thesis a relationship is constructed by analysing
both scientific research and literature by artists.
A focus on data and knowledge is gained from speculation and
experimental theories; and it is by using these sources that
a new insight into listening can be explored and understood.
Scientists that question methods of measurement and push
certain boundaries are normally limited by standardisation.
Here, examples of primary research are shown that divulge
the findings of physical experiments to focus the study of
electromagnetic listening in a wireless age and examine how
navigational movement is being affected. The sequences of
artistic references come together to form a potential hidden
language of this electro-infrastructure.

	Part 1: Signals and their Receptions as Shifting Phenomena
	<br>
	<br>
	Chapter 1: Listening to Immortal Noise
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
Among the electro-infrastructures the ‘act of listening’ has
to take place for information or noise to even be received.
This ‘act’ involves the event site (a moment and place in
time) and the ‘listening’ function as the conversion of energy
into mechanical process (a tuning of the Hertzian wave).
Human senses achieve this through the ear and supplying a
“network of signals traveling and exchanging information
within the body-mind complex” (Fedorova, 2013: 1). Indeed,
the mode of listening to electromagnetism is one that lies
in the virtual rather than a material anthology. Drawing the
virtual as perception of space that is absurd to the accustomed
senses, the particles in the virtual show “speed or
brevity [that] subjects them to a principle of the unconsciousness”.
(Delueze, 1977: 112). It is fascinating to comprehend
that electro and magnetic wave particles travelling
through space are inaudible to the established ear. They are
not sounds, but instead part of the electromagnetic spectrum:
one that rules a range of frequencies from Gamma rays to visible
light and microwave rays to radio signals. This virtual
field composes and stimulates our known world of perception
and remains animate in the process.
<br><br>
In a sensorial difference to vision, sound can have any orientation
– horizontal, vertical, upside down, inside out.
This gives it infinite scope and a vast, dynamic area to explore.
The acoustic space is “(…) boundless, directionless,
horizonless, the dark of the mind (…)” (McLuhan, 1955: 26).
A removal of the seer (one who sees), lies them down in a
world of polycentrism. In this world, there are infections,
instant information-occupation, inputs on inputs and signals
that both penetrate and permeate. All of this cannot be unheard.
The body is therefore embedded in this ecology as the
19th and 20th century French sociologist terms a “technical
object” (Mauss, 1934: 75).
<br><br>
In the ecology of sound (acoustic and virtual frequency terrain)
there are two methods of hearing: ‘listening’ and ‘understanding’
– the ‘sense’ and the ‘truth’. The sensation
of sound does not require tools whereas the understanding
and actuality (without interpretation) requires a knowledge
of decipherment. The messages of signals are the content in
which our human bodies are resonating without tools. The
acoustical rendering by the ear in the sequence of linear
time is one of limiting

  <div class="content7">
perceived experience. An access to
listening without the requirement of the ear would re-configure
realism and increase manoeuvering in sensation. Let us
abolish the rendering of the known ear and allow enhancement
of the ‘Radio Ear’ of which the pioneering early 20th century
Soviet film director and theorist Dziga Vertov explains: “I
had an idea about the need to enlarge our ability for organized
hearing. Not limiting this ability to the boundaries
of usual music. I decided to include the entire audible world
into the concept of ‘Hearing’”. (Vertov, 1935). Accessing
this world with more ranging-depth is achieved through an act
of hearing that takes a position distant from the existing
world frame, therefore evoking a need for pluralism.

Using this portrait by the early 20th century Russian designer
and actor Pyotr Galadjev, the term ‘Radio Ear’ is re-issued
as a mode of listening to the world of electromagnetic
noise. This term unfolds throughout the thesis as a tool that
can be used to access the soundscape of the field of noise.
This ‘Radio Ear’ becomes our own technical object for accessing
more, through the very ‘act of listening’ and is not limited
by our existing ear architecture. This previously known
audible world was “contracted to the dimensions of the ear
world.” (Connor, 2010).
<br><br>
Noise. Noise. Noise - a continuous landscape, a new infinite
world, an overburdening shadow superimposed on the existing
one. Italian Futurist painter/composer in the early 20th century,
Luigi Russolo proclaimed that through the “(…) invention
of the machines noise was born.” (Russolo, 1913: 23). As
humans we are creating the space that we inhabit, structurally
augmenting our own created experiences from it. Given the
impulse of machine production a new variety of listening became
an added experience, and this machine spectrum of noise
is an entanglement of sensation, in multitudes of layers. As
previously stated, sound has no orientation; a further development
would be that noise has no orientation in time. These
noise emissions spread far and wide, reflecting on our own
production of space. Luigi Russolo created the ‘Noise Instrument
Laboratory’ in 1913, generating sounds of machines from
acoustical sources – strings and rotating forms that were
amplified through siren structures: a sonic representation of
industrialisation. This noise is so layered that it can never
be fully revealed to listening as understanding and remains
a fluxing sensation. It shifts the objective output of the
“machine [to] allow us to hear not only the environment, but
ourselves hearing.” (Fedorova, 2016: 125). Moving away from
the acoustical sense, we detach the singularity of form and
revisit our own contemporary ‘Radio Ear’. This ear is being
educated and objectively tailored by our technological
setting: the ‘virtual hybrid space’. This arena of floating
electrical noise is named ‘The Ether’. It is not categorised
through geographical objective terms (mountain, lake, tree)
but as an “intersubjective field of relations” (Flusser,
1992: 53) – this is where the hybrid character joins the virtual.
I regard to this virtual as being a mode of depth as
a “space that opens up behind the surface” (Foucault, 1984:
4). This comes into cohesion with French philosopher Michel
Foucault’s idea of ‘Heterotopic space’ where one is neither
in one place or another but able to experience multiple mixed
experiences at once in a given physical space. An attribute
focused through the perception of the ‘Radio Ear’ as a panoply
of signals unfolds.

In terms of signals with value (communication purposes),
identification can only be made by running them against invaluable
waves: the aforementioned noise. This can be construed
as a reverse process of seeing what you don’t want
- subtracting this from the signal of value. It is this mere
act of transduction that creates value as “unprocessed data
will always remain as noise.” (Schuppli, 2018). It is a process
of transformation, immaterial deletion, resulting the
output signal to act as metadata – it still holds noise in
its processing and final form.

During several visits during November 2018 to Goonhilly Earth
Station in Cornwall, UK on-site technicians revealed this
exact process to myself. This entailed feeding noise into a
spectrum analyser to create data awareness of what should
then be disposed of. Once the noise was centralised it is
removed (silenced) from the unique required signal; in turn,
creating and boosting a clearer image or path of communication.
The result was a scientifically produced image of a
signal that holds meta-information of everything it is not.
<br><br>
This process of silencing shows the value of data in the surrounding
ocean of noise. For the Goonhilly engineers to produce
and process signals of value there had to be an awareness
of noise and to work with it. Noise is therefore not
worthless but a productive energy in communication. It is
useful to understand that this ‘magic-removal’ is a trick: it
does not actually shift particles in space but is merely a
process of technical sorcery. The tailoring of a signal is a
process of meta-coding; noise becomes a concrete function in
the production process. The final outcome is an artificially
engineered signal that is listened or seen by the listener/
seer/customer without any idea of the meta-code. This dayto-
day encryption is fed into all consumed information. Our
body-mind complex does not have the required tools to unpack
and descramble these meta-information signals. Evoking the
need for the

introduction of the ‘Radio Ear’ (technical apparatus)
as means of infiltration to processes of our information
receptions. This contributes to a view of more condensable
and stacked mixed media environment. Where a mode of
pluralism with multiple codes, channels, images and cognitive
maps arises. The ‘Radio Ear’ is actually a shift in perception
opening the imagination and virtuality to a greater periphery
rather than replacing existing sensorial structures.

    Chapter 2: The Ether as Non-material

“I’ve taken a sip from the cup that slips into ether.”
(Coil, 1999)
	</div>
<br><br>
‘The Ether’ is a medium – a non-place produced by the noise
of our existence. The space derives from the multiplication
of machines, crafted by the development of production since
the Agricultural Revolution in the 18th and early 19th centuries
in Europe. This arena is a result of our manufacturing
of space – an ephemeral state that reflects on our desire to
produce. With the rise of the late 20th and 21st century’s
‘Information Age’ sabotaged this space into a means of communication.
A stack upon the prior machine noise. Language
and data could scout the skies and uncover emissions waiting
to be decoded. The phenomena of these hypermodernising developments
led to processes of globalisation, hybridisation
and digital convergence that pressurised a concept of the
‘shrinking world’. A rapid technological growth (transport,
manufacturing, distribution and communication) that shortcuts
modes of living to give the geographical illusion of a
smaller connected world. This time-space compression placed
production over listening. ‘The Ether’ became a component
of communication but in doing so it delivered a by-product:
‘Immortal Noise’. The tools responsible for this outcome are
technological objects called antennas that send and receive
signals of electrical and magnetic particles that drift tangled
together in space. Frequencies embedded in ‘The Ether’
become carriers of electromagnetic waves of both valuable
communication and noise signals.

	“This new other time is that of electronic transmission, of
	high-tech machines, and therefore, man is present in this

The separation through hierarchy does not exist in <br>
‘The Ether’. The infection of information and disinformation is
equal in the electromagnetic field as <br>it vastly pollutes the
invisible space. It is the receiver who tunes themselves as
a technical object of filtering and creating subjective hierarchy.
The plenitude of this raw material represents a landscape
that is ripe for mining. A labouring act of prospect
requires sifting through endless dirt to receive an ore of
value. This ore is non-material; it is not an object, but an
energy with specific frequency profit. Drilling for this ore
has no effect on the virtual space of ‘The Ether’ as signals
still drift and noise frequencies can never be removed. It
just shifts in perceptual notion and creates a technical simulation
of deletion.

 The whole earth can be seen as seated within ‘The Ether’ and
its electromagnetic currents, where a complex interaction
of these energies has a pervasive quality. This field acts
as a comprehensive data set of the ancient world, the present
world and co-ordinates of the next world. It is a “quasi-
media” (Schuppli, 2018) produced from “natural phenomena”
(Schuppli, 2018) before even being transduced or utilised.
Revisiting Douglas Kahn’s encouragement of re-perception by
criticizing the “(…) problem with object orient anthology is
that there is a plenitude of objects but no plenitude of energies.”
(Douglas Kahn, 2010). With this in mind, a re-focus
should be drawn to the difference between the electro-infrastructures
that produce the electromagnetic space, and the
space itself. One cannot exist without the other, but their
physicality, occupation and lifespan are very different. Human
beings perceive and measure the ever-shifting virtual as
an energy-influence on movement within both our bodies and
our minds. In fact, it is interesting to note that the electrical
property of signals is similar to the chemistry of
nerve signals. In juxtaposition, the object of the antenna is
merely a technical tool for metamorphosis of such energy.
<br><br>
The processing of information from ‘The Ether’ is done by a
method of transduction, a conversion of electrical energy to
mechanical. I, myself have touched and sipped The Ether. I
have drowned in the noise and become alert to patterns forming
in my brain as I attempt to devour the humming, whistling,
whirling, whining buzzes, crackling clicks and screams
of rushing information. I drink it all in, without filters.
The technological object I hold and the orientation of my
own geo-positioning is a filter in itself. However, I am not
blocking signals entering my body, but am a locked open door
for signals to flow through. The harvesting apparatus I hold
is a Loop Antenna, coiled in form and abstractly converting
very low frequencies (VLF) into my ‘Radio Ear’. This coil in
my hands is constructed solely from one metal – copper. The
size of the metallic loop determines the types of signals
able to enter my ‘Radio Ear’ and the amount of copper will
amplify and intensify these signals. This form of harvesting
the skies field of noise envelopes one’s own image of the
information world. Language, signs and symbols can be mined
from this inter-dimensional position.
<br><br>
'The Ether’ exists as a property of the sky, levitating our
electro-infrastructure as a “(…) charged landscape” (Paglen,
2018). Astronomers identify objects in this skyscape such
as planets, moons, flying rocks and satellites. There is
clarity in that the object is clearly seen and therefore
exists with a purpose and meaning. In the electromagnetic
field, we do not see objects; only it’s energy can be transduced
through the act of listening. This creates difficult
translations of language in comparison to

Through the methods of the telescopically-enhanced eye a
level of predictability is obtained. Vision and laws of physics
craft the sky into a real space. German Mathematician,
astronomer and astrologer, Johannes Kepler developed three
laws of planetary motion. By examining his ‘Law of Motion’,
proposed in the early 1600s, we can identify routes that material
in the sky will take. Using this psychology of mathematical
fortune telling, an artificial ‘next-image’ can be
displayed in the mind’s eye. In the work of contemporary
American artist and geographer, Trevor Paglen captures military
and ghost satellites which are traced over long exposures
to demonstrate their existence, positioning and movements
around and above the Earth. This ‘next-image’ forecast
leads to a model that can be identified as a straight line.
In a pictorial sense these lines are logical visualisations,
crafted from models of our own experiences of relation. However,
these lines are merely imagined spaces, supported only
by visual cues. They can be compared to ‘Ley Lines’ - an
alignment of sites that conform to the notion of a straight
line through geographical surface space. These are often referenced
as a spiritual dimension being transcended into surface
value – an imagined signifier of another world. A world
constituted from energies of the past.
<br><br>
The description of vertical and horizontal is normally also
viewed in a linear methodology. Two points; left to right
or up and down. When describing the space between the two
points the linguistic outcome directly shifts to a straight
line. When considering sound and its’ vibrations – sound
does not visually appear as a straight line but an oscillating
one that we can call a curve in time. A single tone such
as a ‘Sine’ is represented as a series of curves moving up
and down endlessly. In the method of electromagnetic transduction,
the ‘Radio Ear’ is acquiring a series of sines all
tangling together – a chaos of curves moving from one point
to another. This multiplication of stacking waves blurs like
a series of object shadows into one meta-image. This is the
non-linear visual alternative to prediction, and keeps the
listener in the moment of sensation (sense) rather than understanding
(truth).

Since the Information Age the sky began to become an archival
library of electronic history. It transformed the known atmosphere
into a “strange chaos (…) The air itself is one vast
library, on whose page are forever written (…) ” (Charles
Babbage, 1837). Early 20th century Russian Constructivist El
Lissitzsky stated in his 1923 manifesto the ‘Electro-Library’
that “(…) the new book demands the new writer.” (Lissitzsky,
1923). Lissitzsky was interested in producing a universal
visual language from new forms of art and design. These were
influenced by new technologies of transport, science and communication
which developed a language of form to illustrate
current modes of modern living. His manifesto became an investigation
into new mediums of typography, of which one can
see similarities to a digital interface like the internet.
Much like his manifesto demanded, a new theory of medium must
also be coined for today’s Post-Information Age. The perception
through the ‘Radio Ear’ creates a new formulation
of language to assist imagining the ambiguous space of ‘The
Ether’.

In this new self-produced space, there needs to be a re-consideration
given to every aspect of representation. This
could be achieved in the sense of non-horizontal, non-vertical
thinking:
<br><br>
The horizontal: The plane of human existence, the space we
physically inhabit and manifest.
<br><br>
The vertical: The productions and occupations infiltrating
up-and-down space.
<br><br>
Both axes orientated dimensions refer back to the linear
conditioning of the ‘straight line understanding’ (linear
truth). Swiss philosopher, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi practiced
a series of teaching techniques during the late 18th
and early 19th centuries that can be described as ‘dimensional
object lessons’ – learning to look and draw. The principle
was to study an object in all its magnitude – form, relation
and transitions as a measurement of a plenitude of possibilities.
A drawing exercise by Pestalozzi shows the rules of
arithmetic and dimensional qualities by visually undertaking
the construction of fractions. Pestalozzi used this method
for understanding space in a mode of plural dimensions,
sticking however to the basis of the vertical, horizontal and
straight lines.

In the drawings, prints and sculptures by 20th century Russian
Constructivist, Naum Gabo a functioning representation
of this non-formal and unfolding space is illustrated. In the
1920 text ‘The Realistic Manifesto’ Gabo and his older brother,
the Russian sculptor Antoine Pevsner elaborate on how all
objects have their own ‘essential image’. These images contain
entire worlds with “their own rhythms, their own orbits.”
(Gabo and Pevsner, 1920). Much like the antenna as an
object, it also relays its own world of energies as it penetrates
space. In Demand 3 of ‘The Realistic Manifesto’ they
state: “We renounce volume as a pictorial and plastic form of
space; one cannot measure Space in volumes as one cannot measure
liquid in yards: look at our space (…) what is it if not
one continuous depth?” (Gabo and Pevsner, 1920). The process
of unfolding form and space is a notion to The Ether’s dimensional
property that is in a state of never-ending transformation.
In his text ‘The Fold’ French philosopher, Gilles
Deleuze describes virtual space;
<br><br>
	<div class="quote11">
“the infinite fold separates or moves between matter and
soul, the façade and the closed room, the outside and the
inside. Because it is a virtuality that never stops dividing
itself, the line of inflection is actualized in the soul but
realized in matter, each on its own side”
(Deleuze, 1993: 35).
	</div>
<br><br>	
For ‘The Ether’, a new type of geographical referencing would
fall outside the brackets of two planar dimensions. I am now
proposing a dimensional re-draw of ‘The Ether’ in a similar
arithmetic manner to both Pestalozzi’s and the Russian Constructivist
teachings. The antenna object can be used here
as a starting point for visually exercising this cartography
of ‘The Ether’. A series of these antennas is called an array;
it combines the objects in a sequence that is normally
voiding the horizontal or vertical planes. These array systems
are the responsible objects for crafting the energetic
system within the electromagnetic field. For example, the
‘Chicksands array’ is designed by placing a circle within a
circle. Chicksands is a former Royal Air Force station in
Bedfordshire, UK. This cartographic source can help further
illustrate the mode of which antennas digest and produce the
space above.

The space of ‘The Ether’ can also be described as lying diagonally,
possessing a non-linear and more spatial property.
With this idea of the diagonal, an equilibrium is met between
the horizontal and the vertical planes. This is however,
not enough to illustrate the electromagnetic space. In
‘The Ether’ diagram I have sketched, an additional circular
notion of time has been portrayed curating a “time axis manipulation”
(Parikka, 2015: 9). The drawing borrows from the
iconic, historically recurring structure of the ‘Ouroboros’
as a visually unfolding picture of time – structurally similar
to the circular properties of antenna array systems. The
symbol of the snake consuming its own tail was first founded
in Ancient Egyptian iconography. Discovered in the tomb
of Tutankhamun in 1922, a depiction of the underworld illustrates
the walls with two coiled snakes in ‘Ouroboros’ form.
The circular forms are commonly decoded to ideas on cycles,
perpetuity and resurrection. As a depiction of space, it is
a clear representation applicable to ‘The Ether’ – an architecture
without end and formless disorder. It “refers to the
mystery of cyclical time, which flows back into itself”.
(Jan Assmann, 2017). ‘The Ether’ diagram that I have illustrated
concentrates on a level of depth beyond mathematics
of planar geometry. Instead, it exhibits a representation
of time in the invisible space of stacking information and
noise. This new layer of the Earth’s extended diagonal and
elliptical geography is dominated by the morphological production
of human activities shifting into the virtual, shifting
into ‘The Ether’.

What would happen if we stepped into The Ether…
<br><br>
We have come to the hypothesis of ‘The Ether’ as a spatial
phenomenon. It holds abstract properties of geographical
dimensions and transforms in a place that is outside of our
known perceptions.
<br><br>
Discussed here is a second discovery about orientation within
this space. Similar to the force of gravity the electromagnetic
waves in ‘The Ether’ has capabilities of effecting
objects, but in a subtler way. In this sense the ‘field
of noise’ has the potential to slowly re-manoeuvre physical
properties as well as shift our perception of the invisible.
As previously discussed, when attempting to deconstruct ‘The
Ether’ significant impacts on our perception of images and
sensations frequently arise. The concentration now falls on
the potential physical effects of the electromagnetic field.
<br><br>
In bird navigation, there is a biomineral within the boundaries
of the skull that allows for a sense called ‘Magnetoreception’.
Through the use of this mineral (magnetite) a
bird can perceive the electromagnetic waves in ‘The Ether’
to understand direction and altitude. It becomes a natural
Geographical Positioning System (GPS) that allows for the
bird to migrate across continents without becoming lost. An
inbuilt map is neurologically unfolded by perceiving electro-
currents across the Earth’s surface. This is called an
electroreceptive system and can be seen as a “technological
extension of consciousness”. (Wigley, 2015: 286).
<br><br>
In 1862 French experimental biologist Cyril Viguier elaborates
on the working method of this innate sense in birds
that is formulated by a process of comparison. To further
explain: a bird must be able to navigate through understanding
changes in the environment. When a pigeon is released and
undergoes the homing process, it embarks by comparing the new
location’s magnetic state to the known-home magnetic state.
Through the calculations of difference, it is able to navigate
the space between with assumed direction.

What is interesting is the fact that the magnetic measurement
is not only undertaken by perceiving one element. It is broken
down into three components: “its intensity, inclination
(the angles which a compass needle makes with the horizon)
and declination (the angle between magnetic and geographical
north). These vary more or less independently of each other
so that their isolines would form a complex grid.”
(Mathews, 1954: 88).
<br><br>
As stated in the understanding of ‘The Ether’, a more complex
image was concluded where the field is beyond horizontal and
vertical space. What Viguier and other experimental bird scientists
are suggesting is that the space has multiple comparative
dimensions. This plural landscape is then perceived by
a bird through three or more components at a single moment.
This sense creates what is called the ‘navigational map’; a
directional image in the bird’s mind. This visualisation can
be seen as an outcome of utilising ‘The Ether’. A form of
translation occurs where the bird’s senses (magnetic matter
or light-sensitive photoreceptors) decode the electromagnetic
currents into a language. A series of meta-information both
visual and non-visual is produced from a single element of
the electromagnetic wave.
<br><br>
A series of physical tests have been made to experiment with
the interference (noise) from electromagnetism onto the
bird’s navigational map. In 1947, American physicist and astronomer
Henry Lincoln Yeagley attempted to build his own interference
mechanisms to dis-orientate pigeons. This electromagnetic
noise system would disrupt the magnetic sense of the
pigeon, thus malfunctioning its GPS. “Yeagley attached small,
powerful magnets to the wings of pigeons (…) the fluctuating
electromagnetic field induced in the bird’s body when the
wings were beating would swamp any measurement of that induced
by the movement of the body through the Earth’s field”
(Mathews, 1954: 84). This production of noise overpowered the
sense that the pigeon would normally use for directional navigation.
The end results of this test saw a mixed scattering
of pigeons as they flew and wandered with no bearings.
<br><br>
Humans also have an electro-sensitivity similar to birds,
although massively overpowered by the existing sense of vision.
Cyril Viguier suggests that this human sense is one
prominently illustrated by the force of electromagnetism.
He states:
<br><br>
	<div class="quote11">
 “(…) there exists not only in animals but also in
man, a true sense of direction; a sense whose keenness varies
greatly according to the subjects, and… no doubt is located
in an organ just as distinct as that of vision and hearing.”</div>

Like birds we must not compare our senses to computational
and systematic methods. We are a “continually evolving organism,
at once biological and technological, a technology
with biology.” (Wigley, 2015: 287) The aspect of perceiving
noise can act as shaking us awake from the auto-piloted mode
of moving through technological and horizontal capitalistic
life. This day-to-day perpetual navigation is overpowered by
the assumed evidence of our own habit of using the eye.
<br><br>
Instead, a new sensation could be introduced and grown around
the wide-spread information that globally surrounds us. The
abstract element to “communication is that it is designed to
be ‘transparent’; no conversion is supposed to take place.”
(Massumi, 1998). Without this conversion being made, the
virtual would remain unknown to us, as if it was a floating
signifier with locked scrambling encryption. The vast emission
of messages can be decoded to a subject language through
listening as sensation rather than computational understanding.
This relates to the theme of “stenography” (Howse, 2009)
that deems an environment as being coded with a “potentially
secret writing” (Howse, 2009). This language is secret as it
is hidden by our existing perception exercised by existing
sensorial knowledge and representation. The mode of sensation
interprets space and dissolves it down to form an immaterial
language system. This is an experience of reading signals
rather than processing.
<br><br>
Therefore, the responsible element is the reader (someone
willing to decode) who takes transduction into their own
hands. “For the information to make a difference, the receiver
must be primed to make a difference, to interpret or exploit
it. Information is a feed.” (Massumi, 1998). This infiltration
of decoding information or noise is being managed
in the perception of the ‘Radio Ear’ to access a level of
depth, where depth is acquired by looking beyond the surface.
This exterior shell has to be sliced open to reveal a position
of distance (plural worlds). The grass ‘fields of noise’
can be seen by lying down and submerging one’s self between
the blades. In this position, blurred forms are delocalised
from their previous view and an action of “Distant cut-in,
local fold-out.” (Massumi, 1998) takes place. Obtained is a
merging of old perceptions with new perceptions, allowing for
an omni-dimensional standpoint. The ‘transparent’ electro-infrastructure
can therefore be converted into a new form of
language through the cohesion of biology, perception and the
technical new materialism.
<br><br>
The ‘Radio Ear’ is one that is just as distinct as any other
body organ. However, this organ is invisible and requires
a mode of tuning to access its potential knowledge. As the
body enters a mode of tuning to an event it enters the act
of listening in the modes of sensation. An array of sounds
heard by the ‘Radio Ear’ layer on top of

each other competing
for prominent cognitive imagination. These stacked sensations
from electromagnetic noise can be seen as having “shades of
sensation” (Bergson, 1913: 42) that are triggered and categorised
by the intensities of the stimuli.

Likewise, French philosopher Henri-Louis Bergson refers to
the reflection of a moment as having qualitatively distinct
sensations by illustrating “(…) we hold a pin in our right
hand and prick our left hand more and more deeply. At first
we shall feel as it were a tickling, then a touch which
is succeeded by a prick, then a pain localized at a point,
and finally the spreading of this pain over the surrounding
zone.” (Bergson, 1913: 42). The layers of noise and information
in ‘The Ether’ become perceived not through the endless
quantities of systematic understanding but through reaching a
subjective sense of quality. The perception of a noise moves
into an idea, isolated by the abundance of excess. It is isolated
into an effect, a new image generation. A separation
between noise and information is due to the fact that “(…)
the real must be able to move through technological channels
(…)” and allowing for a “(…) dream of making literal reproductions
of the inscribed pathways in their brains.”
(Kittler, 1990: 317).

Much like a phantom limb, there is a perception of something
being present but the eye denies. This new organ of the ‘Radio
Ear’ can be explored to allow for the vision of a scene
and route that is not actually there. Like Ley Lines, these
map systems are imaginary and built from the sky of energies
being grounded. This perception of space creates a mirage in
the mind; an illusion of seeing something that is not there,
commonly associated with acts of looking.
<br><br>
The methods of mirage image manipulation are caused by the
effects of light bending through different qualities of atmospheric
pressure. As we know, visible light also lies on
the electromagnetic spectrum alongside radio frequencies. The
mirage becomes a notion towards a new optical regime born out
of global conditions, processes, laws and physics. This results
in a chain of aesthetic consequences that attribute to
a new quasi-truth, a twisted understanding that sits better
with the notion of sensations. It is therefore plausible to
link the effects of the optical mirage to the fictional imagination
of electro-topology, perceived by the ‘Radio Ear’.
This results in a cognition of spatial awareness by building
images through subjective measurements of ‘The Ether’. . .
a floating map in our minds-eye crafted by electro-sensitivities.
This develops ‘an aesthetic interpretation’ so that the
human as a technical object can become “the observer to the
‘invisible’ presence of these networks.”
(Kluitenberg, 2006: 14).
<br><br>
Canadian philosopher and social theorist, Brian Massumi illustrates
his own mode of navigation 
<div class="quote11">“Instead of seeing passing
scenes I felt twists and turns coming one after the other
with variable speed. I was going on a bodily memory of my
movements, one of contorsion and rhythm rather than visible
form.”
</div> (Massumi, 2002: 178-9).
<br><br>
Massumi goes on to elaborate on the sense of proprioception,
a way of moving that relies on internal signals. This involves
balance, force and depth being broken down into
relatable body parts in space. The idea of the internal is
far different from the sensual ‘exoreferential’ sense of
vision, where an understanding of images only exists through
an external mode. Massumi’s description of moving through
space closes the external inputs and relies on a cognitive
map, a mode of intuition to allow getting from A to B. However,
the methodologies of a non-visual external input into
the modes of navigation are proposed here: the electromagnetic
input of the virtual noise infrastructure or ‘The Ether’
Routes. The aforementioned pigeon experiments by Yeagley also
had electromagnetic directional finding pathways based on the
neurology of proprioception. The pigeons based electromagnetic
differentiation from two different

locations, to paint a
mental image to fly home. Through the modes of mineral biology,
mirage perception and electro-sensitivities a new aesthetic
pathway is also unfolded for humans from the electromagnetic
field.This is a pathway built from an aesthetic result of a technical
tool’s influence on perception. A method also utilised in
the Second World Ward by radio navigation tools such as the
Bellini Tosi and Huff Duff. These directional finding tools
used antenna systems that would scout ‘The Ether’ for any
electromagnetic noise. If there were strong noise levels or
particular frequencies, they could map approximate lines of
source direction: normally Military bases or Naval destroyers.
These device outputs created strategies of orientation
based on statistical knowledge of noise as a valuable product.
Both in military, remote sensing science and telecom
business we see the processing of noise to either imagine
space visually or as a tool of reduction. It enters a process
of becoming a key manufacturing component of visual mapping.

In information societies (western-capital-culture), we rely
on maps with valuable information, and understand noise as a
worthless entity. The daily activities we undertake remove
the body from the manufacturing of these activities, which in
turn removes us from the processing of noise. The proposed
shift into the virtual inhabits the process of quantitative
systems to qualitative ones. A new consideration is made in
the means of measuring which turns information landscapes
into imaginary landscapes; a process similar to Cubist painting
ideologies.

These devices and plotting systems work similarly to mobile phone technology today. The
signals from the phone device ping data to antenna structures owned by private telecom
companies. This streams all your data and in turn gives you a fixed position based on
your electromagnetic output-waves. The preciseness of position is based on the signal
strength between the mobile phones own antenna and the nearest telecom tower.

This image is previously mentioned as being a descript source to the non-Euclidean
spatial aspect of ‘The Ether’. On further examination it can be identified that two
‘Ouroboros’ symbols circle both the head and the feet. The iconography has a signifying
value of the mind and movement having equal and binding sensation. As discussed in this
chapter there are virtual images being drawn from ‘The Ether’ into modes of navigational
movement. This Ancient Egyptian example has connotations that do not separate
the endless use of our body’s movement to the infinite perception of the senses being
processed in the mind.

In 1920 the Central Institute of Labour was founded in Moscow
by Russian computational scientist Alex Gastev. The institute
was a lab for sensorics specialising in the operational
complexes of production and the machine in a single, unbroken
chain of events. Experiments undertaken there deconstructed
the movements of humans as they performed simple, labouring
mechanical tasks. In essence a study for efficiency. These
investigations produced “the synthesis between biology and
engineering (…) and the integrated calculated incorporation
of determinate human masses into a system of mechanisms (…)
nothing other than social engineering.” (Smirnov, 2013: 99).
This studied in detail how the human body could be augmented
in space while undergoing the means of production. In relevance
to electromagnetic navigation, Ukranian, 20th century
avant-garde graphic artist, Solomon Niktritin developed a
manuscript that attempted to define a language of these movements.
Rather than having a focus on labour, he concentrated
on the typology systems of human movements in terms of biomechanics
and acoustics. Nikritin made direct links to how the
body moves through a sense like proprioception to sounds in
space. This processing of movement converted the human subject
into a ‘technical object’ similar to an antenna, able to
transcend electrical waves into mechanical movement. It would
indicate that “man is also a living radio transmitter” (Playfair
and Hill, 1979: 93) as well as a receiver, much like
American industrial designer, Gilbert Rohde’s image of the
‘Man of Tomorrow’, where the body is depicted as an instrumental
extension of radio waves.

Landmarks in visual orientation become triggers for advancing
movements of the body. Much like a trigonometrical point on
a mountain top, they become blurred, distant images of positional
desire. This linear method of utilising landmarks
exposes and describes the notion of horizontal space. A mathematical
calculation is noted between the self and the object
through a reference of distance. A perception is conceived
and built up of metrics and quantitative data assumptions as
ruling experiences of spatial navigation.

Being led by this straight line is verisimilitude (theoretical
truth in relation); for example, in a cityscape environment
a high point of architecture like a church tower may
act as a visible landmark. A sequence of these physical landmarks
become the orchestrators of choreographing the movement
of people. In a 1470 map of Florence, Italy the ever-rising
structural landmarks that scatter the city skyline can be
observed. This traditional form of the map becomes a physical
source of data representing something, somewhere, unknown and
distant from the self – a projection of virtual geography.
The map is virtual as it visualises and translates an undiscovered
space. In perception, the space is a non-existent experience,
it is only available in the imagination through the
assisting technological tool of the map. Which in itself is
a basis of subjective knowledge, a visual interpretation and
moves from the objective to a “post-representational cartography”
(Fedorova, 2015: 46).<br><br>
The pluralistic nature of a series of electro-object landmarks
are pictured in this series that demonstrates the
disguised nature of removing visual denotations of invasive
electro-presence. Existing landmark structures such as
churches, water towers, factory chimneys and clock towers are
being re-appropriated by added-on constructions of antennas.
This is fueled by the privatisation of telecommunications,
rapid network growths and governmental surveillance. It is
living proof of the object state of ‘The Ether’ and the landmark
“(…) gadget then takes place [of] the invisible source
itself.” (Dolar, 2006: 63). The towers become a series of
semaphores communicating a chain of signals to the subject,
whether they are aware or not. Previously, structures such as
the bell tower would have been used as soundmarks. A soundmark
is a non-visual indicator of time but also a ‘position
in time’. The noise produced from the ringing bells, trigger
a moment of self-reflection in a precise present and fleeting
state. The signals now emitting from these re-appropriated
towers are based on the electromagnetic signals both in information
and noise. And, similar to the ‘ding-dong’ of the
bells they play a non-visual alternation to the perception
of space and time. The subjects reading the soundmarks are
indeed us, and renders the idea that “society is technology
made permeant.” (Peters, 2018).
<br><br>
Now let us picture the same landmarks of bell towers, but
in heavy fog – a mask that limits all views of horizontal
and vertical positioning: a blind-desert scenario with only
your feet for ground. The repeating peals of the bell tower
flood the fog plane and a visual hallucination is triggered.
An image of the physical space through the illustration of
sound waves starts to emerge in the mind. This imagination of
a new spatial quality is one that is already ever-present.
By changing our ears to ‘Radio Ears’ (antenna receivers) and
transducing the electro-magnetic field we can begin to become
cartographers of a new field of vision.

The ‘Immortal Noise’ from antennas that over populates this
field is much like a fog, a never-ending storm of whirling
information. Moments of calm fall when patterns in noise are
processed. Much like an optical mirage it is necessary to
find placement and perspective in the imaginary space. This
is done through listening and learning, a labouring, mining
process to extract points of interest and points of reference.
These new invisible landmarks are similar to magnetic
poles with strong pulses dominating a map for our in-built
compass. The technical tool of the compass is replaced by the
extension of the body through the ‘Radio Ear’. This creates a
“(…) third hinge-dimension of experience (…)” (Massumi, 1999:
182) that opens new modes of navigation and positioning. The
prior experience of horizontal and vertical presupposes a set
of Cartesian co-ordinates, producing an exact point of being.
This referential point of the event and the perceiver now has
to be reframed into “a place of being” (Ganchrow, 2010).

The landmarks of the electro-infrastructures hold inscriptions
of meta-information to be decoded in a realm of localism
and globalism. These invisible inscriptions attached
to the source structures hold the language systems for a new
aesthetic thought. The camouflaged nature of antenna towers
becoming even more invisible shifts informational activities
into a space of non-orientation and into a “space of flows”
(Kluitenberg, 2006: 6). This vision of space is not detached
from the physical ‘real space’, it is indeed a contributor to
the purpose, interaction and movement of society. The development
in strategies to disguise information landmarks deceives
the public of accessing the existing virtual space.
Drawing to the idea that “(…) if we don’t see them, then we
don’t attribute to them the agency their role deserves.”
(Bridle, 2014: 6). This re-confirms the fact that opening an
investigation into biology’s magentorecpetion, neural networks
and cognitive visual mapping becomes a prime essential
in sensing the invisible.

French composer Michel Chion
states: “(…) what is important is the space inhabited and
defined by the sound, more than its multisource origin”
(Chion, 1994: 79).
<br><br>
The known interface of the antenna tower conceals the network
of invisible processes behind it. The architectural interfaces
themselves do not shape the perception of society, but
instead shape their actual mechanisms of processing information.
The “space of flows” (Kluitenberg, 2006: 6) can also be
seen as an “Augmented space” (Lev Manovich, 2002: 223). This
arena places points in physical space that contain levels
of meta-information and adds “new dimensions to a 3-D physical
space, making it multidimensional.” (Lev Manovich, 2002:
223). This steps our ‘real space’ outside of the Euclidean
perspective and reveals non-geometrical stacks of data noise.
The once assumed line of sight is now only a basic knowledge
of seeing with the new interrelation between object and its
produced energy being introduced rapidly. The ‘Radio Ear’
(technical tool of transduction) envelopes away from spatial
logic and into our self-built ‘augmented space’. This results
in a “transductive anthropology” (Helmreich, 2009: 225) where
the listener can define “distortions and resistances, turbulence
that might reveal the conditions beneath any self-evident
‘presence’” (Helmreich, 2009: 225). This very act of
listening to the electro-infrastructure permits a sense of
being that positions the subject into a moment of orientation.
The listener goes through a process of ‘returning’ to
themselves while also ‘encountering’ themselves. It is this
transcendental layering of sensations that occurs when transducing
radio signals where a moment is formed that indicates
a “presence in presence” (Nancy, 2002: 16). This is not perceived
as a state moment but as a reflection on one’s own
orientation – an animate energy runs through them, down their
‘Radio Ear’. A decisive moment takes place, bearing the act
of the very next step.

spire interiors in North America are now large telecom masts concealed away from the
public eye. The church bell tower conversion into a landmark within the electro-infrastructure
represents a ‘technical object’ for accessing ‘The Ether’.

Conclusion: <br>Transducting Psychic Representation
    </div>
<br><br>
Through a series of measurements described in the text an
array of mechanisms arise that are fundamental in the inquisition
of invisible space. These are the ‘Radio Ear’, ‘The
Ether’ and the habitation within ‘Immortal Noise’. The known
sky extends itself from object-landmarks, into a sonicscape
liquidised with a cacophony of noise and information –
a bonded non-material entity.
It is by engaging with the invisible that a sequence of new
notions can be drawn on linguistic, visual and semiotic levels.
The object-orient (landmark) viewpoint is one of access
to ‘The Ether’, this is now being extended to an energy-orient
(electromagnetic) sphere through the very act of listening
via the ‘Radio Ear’. These gates of access are points
of execution holding the locks to enter ‘The Ether’. Behind
these curtains of physicality, a series of invisible inscriptions
emerge that flow and dance in space. These messages
produced by technology, consumerism, production and economic-
capital are there to be harvested, like any other raw material.
This vast appendix of surrounding electromagnetic energies
is ripe to be mined and labored by one’s ‘Radio Ear’,
object identification and an extenuating sense that expands a
more peripheral experience.

It is the mere fact that ‘Immortal Noise’ is never binary
(on or off) but fades down to a series of stacked layers of
information, allowing for new platforms of experience to be
uncovered and re-stacked in a subjective ordering of depth.
This new formulation of signals, communication and noise
is at the heart of sensation and understanding. Through a
geo-psychic re-ordering of this invisible domain, a developed
cartography of an imaginary landscape emerges. This panoply
of signals holding meta-information embarks on pluralism for
a self-global positioning system. Also, the tuning of certain
signals via the ‘Radio Ear’ is an act of moving towards them,
stepping closer and illuminating a focus on blurred profiles.
The body, therefore becomes similar to a single neuron, growing,
transforming, feeding and self-canalising towards stronger
signals/noise/information.<br><br>
What arises now is that through sensations of the existing
space a new arena can be redrawn through dowsing the in-between
heavens via an electro-sensitive perception. This entity
being actively processed is never static, never stagnating
but stuck in the flowing currents of transformation. Thus,
‘The Ether’ as illustrated through an elliptical multi-dimensional
axis constitutes itself as a non-material property
without a focus of the absolute for definition. Evoking a
non-stationary immaterial language system to surface –
calculated through “(…) consciously attending to sonic textures,
masses, and velocities” (Chion, 1994: 32).<br><br>
Both scientific and artistic measurements of the invisible
are sources of knowledge for interpretation that allow for
the imaginary to appear from the depths of information and
noise. This is a post-optimal space, coated with effects,
illusions and tales from distant shorelines of signals. From
this second-layer of the geographical plane, a subjective
signal translation can further illustrate, navigate and draw
out a new aesthetic proposal from the present stacking of
‘Immortal Noise’.
